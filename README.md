 In the contemporary pursuit of healthier living, the management of dietary habits plays a pivotal role. However, the complexity of creating personalized diet 
plans and tracking nutritional values often poses a time-consuming and costly challenge. Addressing these issues and aiming to provide users with convenience, 
we introduce our project, "CalorieCrafter." CalorieCrafter is a web-based platform developed using HTML and JavaScript, designed to empower users with insightful 
information about the caloric, protein, carbohydrate, and fat content of the meals they consume.
